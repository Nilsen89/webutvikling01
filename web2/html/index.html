				<p> <b>Go</b> (traditional Chinese: 圍棋; simplified Chinese: 围棋; pinyin: About this sound wéiqí; 
				Japanese: 囲碁; rōmaji: igo[nb 2]; Korean: 바둑; romaja: baduk[nb 3]; 
				literally: "encircling game") is an abstract strategy board game for two players, 
				in which the aim is to surround more territory than the opponent.
				<br><br>
				The playing pieces are called "stones". 
				One player uses the white stones and the other, black. 
				The players take turns placing the stones on the vacant intersections ("points") 
				of a board with a 19×19 grid of lines. Beginners often play on smaller 9×9 and 13×13 boards,
				and archaeological evidence shows that the game was played in earlier centuries on a board with a 17×17 grid. 
				However, boards with a 19×19 grid had become standard by the time the game had reached what was then the 
				Imperial Chinese Tributary State of Korea in the 5th century CE and later to what was then the Imperial Chinese 
				Tributary State of Japan in the 7th century CE.
				<br><br>
				The objective of the game—as the translation of its name implies—is to surround a 
				larger total area of the board than the opponent.
